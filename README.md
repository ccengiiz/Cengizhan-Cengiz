Description: This repository publishment encompasses two primary components of a comprehensive simulation tool developed for metocean data acquisition and analysis and floating offshore wind installation operations.

Metocean Data Acquisition and Analysis: The first component is dedicated to the acquisition and analysis of real-world metocean data, focusing on selected geographic locations, including potential ports and offshore wind energy sites. This data, sourced from the Copernicus Climate Change Service's ERA5 Dataset, undergoes detailed collection and processing, specifically wind speed and significant wave height. Python scripts facilitate data extraction and statistical analysis, utilizing models such as the Weibull and Rayleigh distributions for wind speed and wave height analysis. Additionally, this segment encompasses metocean condition determination and weather window availability analysis, crucial for FOWT deployment tasks. It plays a key role in operational planning, providing developers with insights into the frequency of necessary weather windows.

Simulating Floating Offshore Wind Installations: The second includes source code created in a Python Jupyter environment, simulating the commercial-scale deployment phase of FOWTs. It follows an industry-standard installation workflow, integrating variables such as operational weather conditions, project scale, and location-specific characteristics. Comprising seven Jupyter Notebook cells, it covers data initialization, task definition, constraints, simulation execution over periods ranging from two to fifty years, and visualizations of project and installation task performance, as well as FOWT deployment potential analysis. The objective is to enhance planning for FOWT installations, providing pivotal insights into turbine deployment, installation pacing, and dynamics, ultimately contributing to the strategic development of offshore wind energy infrastructure.

Both components of this publication are instrumental when used together in advancing renewable energy research, especially in the realm of offshore wind developments. By addressing the complexities of metocean data analysis and FOWT deployment dynamics, this tool highlights potential areas and tasks for efficiency enhancement, aiming to propel operational efficiency in the construction phase. It serves as a resource for both industry professionals and researchers in the field.
